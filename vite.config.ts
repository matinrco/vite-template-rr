         * Alias the root import of `react-date-object` to its ES module build.
         *
         * Context:
         * - `react-multi-date-picker` depends on `react-date-object`.
         * - When importing `DateObject` directly from `react-multi-date-picker` like:
         *     `import { DateObject } from "react-multi-date-picker"`
         *   it internally resolves to a CommonJS build, which causes Vite to throw a CJS bundling error.
         *
         * Why this alias:
         * - Instead of importing `DateObject` from `react-multi-date-picker`, I import it directly from `react-date-object`.
         * - To avoid the CJS import issue, I alias the root of `react-date-object` to its ESM build (`dist/index.module.js`).
         * - This allows direct imports like `import DateObject from "react-date-object"` to work correctly with Vite.
         *
         * Scope:
         * - The alias uses a regex (`/^react-date-object$/`) to only target the root import.
         * - Subpath imports like `react-date-object/locales/...` and `react-date-object/calendars/...` continue to work without interference.
         *
         * SSR Note:
         * - Some components from `react-multi-date-picker`, such as `DatePicker`, still cause SSR errors in Vite.
         * - To fix this, I wrap them in a custom `<NoSSR>` component to defer rendering to the client side only.
         *
         * Final Result:
         * ✅ `import DateObject from "react-date-object"` works without bundling errors.
         * ❌ `import { DateObject } from "react-multi-date-picker"` causes a CJS error (even with alias).
         * ✅ `import DatePicker from "react-multi-date-picker"` works when wrapped in `<NoSSR>` to avoid SSR errors.
